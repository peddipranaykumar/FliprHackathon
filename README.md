To start a backend server and a frontend development server, you will need to open two separate terminal windows or tabs.

In one terminal, navigate to the root directory of your backend project and enter the command npm start to start the backend server.

In another terminal, navigate to the root directory of your frontend project and enter the command npm start to start the development server for the frontend.

Make sure to keep both terminals open while you are developing your application, as shutting down either server will cause your application to stop running.
